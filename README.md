# INF584-project
This project is to implement a technique to approximate ambient occlusion based on screen-space, which is SSDO.
Reference papers:
1) Approximating Dynamic Global Illumination in Image Space (SSDO)
2) Hardware Accelerated Ambient Occlusion Techniques on GPUs (SSAO)

Due to the base-code could not be published, only images of output could be found here.
Later I will finish my own version render, and based on this render to transfer the implementation of SSDO. (maybe optimization as well)
